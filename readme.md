# Introduction
On about 2/21/2022, I accepted a coding challenge issued by either Jack Henry & Associates or APEX.  Someone hired Ben to give me the rules of the test and watch me get started.  
I had just started looking at .Net 6 Minimal APIs so I simultaneously learned about Minimal APIs and completed the challenge.  I had 2 days to complete the challenge.

## Original Instructions
The original directions were both verbal and SMS'd to me.  I copied the text to 
[Original Instructions](WebApiApex/readme.md)

## Running Documentation
I left myself a few notes by adding to or editing the original instructions.  That document is here [Running Documentation](RunningDoc.md)

## Conclusion
On 2/25/2022 Zach at APEX said the results came in strong.  On 2/28/2022 I went through the code I wrote with 3 employees of Jack Henry.  I explained what I did.  
I never felt like I stumbled.  The focus was on Dependency Injection and Linq.  I have experience with both so the hardest part was .Net 6, changes to Unit Testing 
and going down the path or Integration testing which I never did get to work.

As of 3/4/2022, I haven't heard anything back.  During our conversaton, I discovered this is a purely backend position.  
I made it clear I wanted Blazor front end work as well as Azure back end work.  The job description listed Blazor but this is just a backend job.  
I suspect this is why I haven't heard back.
